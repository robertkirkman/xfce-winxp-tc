    // NOTE: You would think that theming the panel is simple, right? Just stretch the
    //       taskband texture to the full size of the panel...
    //
    //       ...except no, because we run into yet another GTK bug where for some
    //       reason the filtering applied to stretched textures is blended with
    //       transparency, so you get transparent blending on the edges
    //
    //       ...and even better than that! You'd think we could just repeat the texture
    //       as-is along the x-axis, but NO! Another bug! The texture is repeated with
    //       a transparent gap between each one, unless we downsize it (which is what
    //       the 10px width is for)
    //
    //       Got to love GTK sometimes...
    //
